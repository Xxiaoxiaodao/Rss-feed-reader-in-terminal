# Rss-feed-reader-in-terminal
## Introduction
Let's build an RSS feed reader! Most news websites, blogs, podcasts, maintain a RSS feed which gives real-time content updates. You'll build a tool for fetching and converting the feed with a given RSS feed URL. 

## Requirements
The user can input a RSS feed URL
The reader will display the title, description, and link of original content.
### For an extra challenge
the user can add more than one RSS feed URL
Instead of using a RSS parser library, build the parser yourseld!

## Suggested Implementation
### If you only wnat to pratice working with RSS, you can implement this project in the terminal.
Wrap the code as script
Get the input feed URL from console 
Show the content in plain text
### To get some additional pretice with front-end development, you can work on this project instead to create a web page to display the parsed feed content
